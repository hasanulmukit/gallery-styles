# Image Gallery - Hovering Style

This is an interactive image gallery project that features a hovering style with zoom effects and full-view pop-ups. It uses HTML, CSS (with grid layout and hover effects), and JavaScript to create a seamless and dynamic user experience. When users hover over the images, they zoom in and fill the container, and a pop-up can be triggered to view the images in full size.

## Features

- Grid Layout: Images are displayed in a 3x3 grid, allowing easy addition of more images.
- Hover Zoom Effect: When hovering over an image, it zooms in to fill the container.
- Full-view Pop-up: Clicking on an image opens it in full-screen view, with an option to close it.
- Gradient Background: The background of the gallery features a gradient for a stylish look.
