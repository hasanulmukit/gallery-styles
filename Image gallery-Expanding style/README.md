# Image Gallery-Expanding Style

Image Gallery-Expanding Style is an interactive project that displays a series of images styled as cards. When a card is clicked, it expands to reveal its title in a visually appealing way, while the other cards shrink. The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on modern animations and responsive design.

## Features

- **Interactive Animation**: Cards smoothly expand when clicked, enhancing user engagement.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts the layout for different screen sizes, hiding specific cards on smaller devices.
- **Customizable Backgrounds**: Images are dynamically loaded and styled for a seamless visual experience.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Transitions are implemented using CSS for smooth and natural animations.

## How It Works

- HTML: Defines the structure with a container holding multiple slide elements.
- CSS: Applies styling, including rounded corners, flexible widths, and smooth animations. Uses media queries for responsive design to adjust visibility on smaller screens.
- JavaScript: Handles click events to toggle the active class on the clicked card. Ensures only one card is expanded at a time.

## Customization

- Replace the images in the images/ folder with your own.
- Modify the titles by editing the <h3> elements in the HTML.
- Adjust the transition timing by modifying the transition properties in style.css.
