A responsive image carousel that smoothly transitions between background images, filling the entire viewport. Includes interactive navigation buttons with hover effects.

## 🌟 Features

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the base structure of the app.

2. **Arrow Navigation**:

   - Clicking on the left or right arrow navigates to the previous or next image.

3. **Responsive Layout**:
   - Images fill the viewport, ensuring a visually appealing layout on all screen sizes.
